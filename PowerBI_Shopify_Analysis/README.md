The file is too large to upload to github, so it can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zYbjBbvX9hgIerII0qV3vwFOTHtz88Cx/view?usp=sharing).

The purpose of this project was to familiarize myself with PowerBI by analyzing data from Shopify apps.

The PowerBI file contains three pages:

The first page shows key statistics on the various types of apps, including the total number of apps, a timeline displaying the amount of reviews on specific days, and an average of the app rating sorted by the amount of reviews on each application.

The second page displays a card that calculates the average amount of helpful reviews based on the star rating of reviews and a count of how many times reviews have been marked as helpful by users. It also contains a graph that displays the average rating given on reviews depending on whether or not the developer of the application left a response.

The final page displays three different graphs, all grouped by the individual developers for the applications. The first graph shows a count of total ratings for each developer, the second shows a count of reviews that were rated helpful, and the third shows the total count of developer responses to reviews for each developer.

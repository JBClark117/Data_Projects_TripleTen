The goal of this project was to create a [dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jace.clark/viz/Sprint5Project_17484679832220/Returns) and a [presentation](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jace.clark/viz/Sprint5Project-Story/Story?publish=yes) investigating the reasoning behind high return rates in the Superstore dataset.

The dashboard contains various visuals that break town return rates and counts based on different variables.

These variables include category, subcategory, state, month, and customer.

The presentation explains the important visuals individually, and summarizes the conclusions drawn from them.
